Maven is a project development management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model: builds, dependency management, documentation creation, site publication, and distribution publication are all controlled from the pom.xml declarative file. Maven can be extended by plugins to utilise a number of other development tools for reporting or the build process.
